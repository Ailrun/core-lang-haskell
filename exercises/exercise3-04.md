My G machine takes 12 steps where my template machine takes 8 steps.
However, comparing their step count is not a fair way to compare them.
In the G machine, a single step does not instantiate a single supercombinator,
so it is simple and does not take long time.
On the other hand, in the template machine, single step instantiate a single supercombinator,
so it could be quite complex and take long time.
