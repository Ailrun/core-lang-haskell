Followings are disadvantages for data represented as a function
1. One cannot return list (or any other data type) as a result safely, since machine cannot distinguish it with a function. If you try to make a machine be able to return list, your machine will print a function too.
1. The performance is worse than the previous approach.
1. The method for defining data is not intuitive.

Followings are advantages for data represented as a function
1. One don't need to implement separate primitives and steps for each data type.
1. User can define data without native support of the machine.
